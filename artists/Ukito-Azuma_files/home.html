	<p>Ukito Azuma is a legendary figure in the world of video game music composition. Born in the bustling streets of Tokyo, Japan, Azuma-san's passion for creating mesmerizing soundscapes began at a young age.</p>
    <p>During the late 90s, Azuma found himself immersed in the vibrant world of video game development. It was during this time that he crafted some of the most iconic soundtracks for beloved titles such as "Chrono Trigger" and "Final Fantasy VII."</p>
    <p>Little did Azuma know, his experimentation with electronic beats and atmospheric melodies was paving the way for a new genre of music - weightless grime.
